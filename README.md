This project is an implementation of the **Huffman Coding algorithm**, a widely used compression technique.  

The program:  
- Takes a table of **alphabets and their probabilities**.  
- Builds a **Huffman Tree** based on the probabilities.  
- Generates a **Huffman Code Table** (mapping characters to binary strings).  
- Accepts a user-provided string input, encodes it into a binary sequence of `0`s and `1`s, and then decodes it back to the original string.

## Features

- Builds a Huffman Tree from a set of probability values.  
- Generates prefix-free binary codes for each character.  
- Encodes user input into compressed binary form.  
- Decodes the binary sequence back to the original text.  
- Demonstrates efficient compression and decompression.
